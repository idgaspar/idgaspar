I’m Ismael Delgado Gaspar. I'm a postdoctoral researcher with a background in general relativity, theoretical cosmology, and numerical methods of mathematical–physics. My lines of research are centered around relativistic cosmology, spanning the large-scale structure formation in the universe, the mathematical properties of exact solutions of general relativity, and the interpretation of observational data using inhomogeneous cosmological models
